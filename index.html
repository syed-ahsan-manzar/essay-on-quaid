        Mohammad Ali Jinnah the founder of Pakistan, was born on December 25, 1876, in a house known as Wazir Mansion
        located in Karachi. His father’s name was Jinnah Poonja, and Mother was Mithibai, he belongs to a merchant
        family. He was a great politician and a well-known lawyer of his time. He struggled a lot for the freedom of the
        Muslims of sub-continent and on the behalf of his extraordinary efforts, he was rewarded with the title of
        “Quaid-e-Azam” (the father of the nation) by maulana Mazharuddin.

        Quaid e Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah received his early education from Sindh Madarsat ul Islam and Christian
        missionary school. He went to England for higher education and got admission at Lincoln’s Inn law school in
        London. At the age of 20 he enrolled in Bombay high court when he came back to British India, he was the
        youngest one to enter the bar, where he started to take interest in political affairs of the nation and became
        famous in the next three years. The advocate general of Bombay invited him to work for his bar and after six
        months offered a salary of 1500 rupees per month, which was the huge amount that time but he gently refuses the
        offer and stated that he planned to earn 1500 daily and proved it possible in future by his flawless efforts.
        But as a Governor-General of newly state Pakistan, he fixed 1 rupee as his monthly salary. He was the man of the
        judiciary and sensible personality.

        Jinnah started his political career with Indian National Congress in 1906, then after seven years, he joined the
        Muslim League. He struggled a lot to bring congress and Muslim League to work together but at the same time, he
        found the culture of racialism in the sub-continent and realized that the Muslims of the sub-continent are
        sacrificing their cultural and social rights under the British and Hindus. Then he started his efforts for the
        freedom of Muslims of British India and planned to create an independent state where Muslims could feel the
        breath of freedom. The major strength was the unity of all Muslims organizations in this freedom war, and it is
        the leadership of Quaid e Azam which unites all the Muslims of the sub-continent on the same agenda of having a
        separate state. The creation of Pakistan is the result of bloodshed of thousands of freedom fighters as well as
        the leadership of Jinnah, Pakistan would not come into being without him.

        He was a man of his words and the greatest spokesman, he always stood like a rock in front of opponents and
        never lay down. Gandhi called him “an impossible man ” due to his determinacy over his principles. Jinnah said:
        “Think a hundred times before you make a decision, but once that decision is taken, stand by it as one man”.In
        1930 he became an undisputed leader of all the Muslims of sub-continent and started to lead Muslim League in
        1933. In 1940 Pakistan resolution was drafted by Muslim league at Minar e Pakistan -Lahore which has been proved
        as a backbone in the war of freedom.

        After the Pakistan Resolution passed, he worked day and night and did not worried about his health which was
        going down day by day, but he kept it secret and never disclosed it to anyone, his sacrifice was not for his own
        interest but for the whole Muslim nation. It was due to his wise leadership and vigorous effort that Pakistan
        came into being on August 14, 1947. He was fighting with tuberculosis for many years but never made it his
        weakness, died on September 11, 1948, just 13 months after the creation of this beloved homeland.
